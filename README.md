# Operant-conditioning-box
The operant conditioning chamber is a cornerstone of animal behavioral research. It is developed as a low-cost alternative to the standard operant conditioning chamber or “Skinner box”. The Operant Conditioning box is a laboratory apparatus used to study animal behaviour. It has been constructed based on the Arduino Platform. All the code has been written in C++ to report live data including animal movement and training related data. Because of its affordability provides an opportunity for educational and research purposes and can be used to set up animal laboratories with small budgets for research and instructional purposes.
